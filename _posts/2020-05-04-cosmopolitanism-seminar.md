Past Tuesday, April 28 2020, 15:00 - 17:30 we had a virtual seminar with Paulo Lemos Horta and Bruce Robbins. The discussion was about the concept of _Cosmopolitanism_ in literary studies. We also discussed some texts by Lemos Horta and Robbins that allowed us to contextualize the concept of cosmopolitanism.
